# Overview 

For collecting teleoperated robot trajectories for robot learning the [DROID](https://github.com/droid-dataset/droid) data collection platform is recommended.

For collecting more rudimentary datasets for training transporter networks and other more primitive models, consider using the `moveit2_data_collector` package.
