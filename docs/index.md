# ü§ñ ROS 2 Robotics Research Toolkit

![](./assets/index/robotics_toolkit.jpeg)

This toolkit organises a ROS 2 workspace containing packages for supporting robot learning research applications. Included in this toolkit is documentation for various use cases. Feel free to leave feedback on the official GitHub repository. ‚ù§Ô∏è  Open-source software.

## Supported Hardware Platforms

As this toolkit is built on top of the ROS 2 ecosystem, most packages are robot agnostic and the integration of new robots shouldn't take too much additional work. The toolkit officially supports the following hardware:
